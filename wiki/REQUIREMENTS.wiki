= Requirements =

==Ruby==

Tested with releaeses Release >= 1.8

Ruby additional libs: stomp 

To install ruby libraries I suggest using rubygems (http://rubygems.org/): to install "stomp" you simply need to run

 gem install stomp


==JMS (stomp) broker==

a JMS broker like
* apache activemq (http:://activemq.apache.org)
* fuse message broker (http://fusesource.com/downloads/)

In these two cases 
* you need also Java jdk 1.5. 
* check that Stomp support is enabled in conf/activemq.xml (http://activemq.apache.org/stomp.html)

for instance
{{{
 wget http://mirror.nohup.it/apache/activemq/apache-activemq/5.2.0/apache-activemq-5.2.0-bin.zip
 unzip apache-activemq-5.2.0-bin.zip
 cd apache-activemq-5.2.0
 ./bin/activemq &
}}}
