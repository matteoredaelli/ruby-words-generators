#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

==Ruby==

Install ruby language >= 1.8 from http://www.ruby-lang.org (many Linux distributions include it by defaults)

Install rubygems from http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=126: this tool helps you to install easily additional ruby libraries in a fast way (gem install XXX)

Install STOMP library with "gem install stomp"

==Stomp Server==

I have tested RabbitMQ and ApacheActiveMQ. Choose and install one of them!

== RabbitMQ ==

Install RAbbitMQ from http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html
Add stomp support following the instructions from http://www.rabbitmq.com/plugins.html#rabbitmq_stomp. It is easyÃ§ you have to download two files and copy them in the plugins folder

===Apache Activemq ===

You need Java jdk >= 1.5 (Java 1.6 is better): you can download it from http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp

Set JAVA_HOME with the path where you installed jdk


Download and install/uncompress a JMS broker like apache activemq (http:://activemq.apache.org) or fuse message broker (http://fusesource.com/downloads/)

{{{
 wget http://mirror.nohup.it/apache/activemq/apache-activemq/5.4.1/apache-activemq-5.4.1.bin.tar.gz
 tar xvfz apache-activemq-5.4.1-bin.tar.gz
 cd apache-activemq-5.4.1
}}}

If you are using a Linux/Unix server (see [http://activemq.apache.org/unix-shell-script.html unix]), you can simply

{{{
  bin/activemq start xbean:conf/activemq-stomp.xml
}}}
 
Otherwise

Check Stomp support in the file conf/activemq.xml: if you find  

{{{
        <transportConnectors>
            <transportConnector name="openwire" uri="tcp://0.0.0.0:61616"/>
        </transportConnectors>
   </broker>
}}}

Stomp is not enabled and according to http://activemq.apache.org/stomp.html you should add a line in order to have


{{{
        <transportConnectors>
           <transportConnector name="stomp+nio" uri="stomp+nio://0.0.0.0:61613"/>
        </transportConnectors>
   </broker>
}}}

Start ActiveMQ

{{{
 ./bin/activemq-admin start 
}}}

You can check if activemq and its admin console are available with
 http://localhost:8161/admin/

The dedicated queues for "wg" will be created when you start wordlist generation the first time. Then you can empty or drop them from the admin comsole
